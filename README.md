# Health-Monitoring-System-API

A repository handling APIs associated with aspects of a health monitoring system. Each of the folders contains the APIs associated with that particular module.

The files beginning with "Health_Monitering_System_" in the main directory contain the database schema that will be associated with the project: one containing the diagram representing the connections, while the other represent the SQL code that was used to implement the database tables.
